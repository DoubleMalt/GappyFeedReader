Gappy FeedReader
================

A jQuery feed reader plugin using the Google Feed API based on http://www.zazar.net/developers/jquery/zrssfeed/

I forked their feedreader mainly because I needed to add some date formatting.

If you want to use date formatting for the feed items, you also need to include
